The disk was created as described below. Then the partitions were populated
 and almost all files deleted. Finally the first partition was reinitialized
 to test EXT4_BG_BLOCK_UNINIT.

Furthermore the vmdk version was partially compacted, leaving the image with
 unallocated blocks. Then it was mounted in VirtualBox and VMware, where more
 files were added and deleted. The outcome is an image with "holes" and a
 size greater than the nominal size of the disk. The current versions of
 the reference VMs do handle such images.
