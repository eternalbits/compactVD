# Translation App

The application is translated through [`bundle.properties`](https://github.com/eternalbits/compactVD/tree/master/java/compactVD/src/res/) and [`about.html`](https://github.com/eternalbits/compactVD/tree/master/java/compactVD/resources/io/github/eternalbits/compactvd/gui/), which can be seen in the original directories. I can provide the existing properties, when they exist, or the original when it's a new translation.

It would be nice if you used a compiler program that would allow you to stop at the correct place.
If you use eclipse, remember the following advices:
